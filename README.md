20: Configure and run the robot as an assistant that asks for user input
You have made it this far already - amazing! Good job!

One of the requirements was to run the robot as an assistant that asks the user for some input. Modify the robot so that it will ask for some input and use that input in some way.

Hints

Maybe ask the user to provide the URL of the orders CSV file?

21: Read some data from a vault
Another requirement was to read some data from a vault. Modify the robot so that it reads some data from a local vault file. Store the vault file in the robot project so that it does not require manual setup.

The best practice is to store the vault file outside the robot project, but in this case, we make an exception since we do not want you to store sensitive data in the vault. We just want to see that you know how to access the vault and read some data!

Hints

Maybe store the URL of the robot order website in the vault?
22: Publish your robot in a public GitHub repository
Create a public GitHub repository for your robot and push it there.

23: Verify that it is possible to run your robot without manual setup
Make sure your robot works out-of-the-box just by getting it from the GitHub repository. For example, the vault should be configured so that the robot finds it without manual setup.

24: Take the certification exam
Robot built? Ready to proceed to the next step?

To pass the Robocorp Level 2 Developer Training, we will ask you to share the URL of your public GitHub robot repository in the final exam form. In case you can't get your robot working, please ask for advice on our forum or Robocorp Slack (#rpa-developer-training).

You will see if you passed the exam at the end of this exam. You can take the exam as many times as you need and use Robocorp docs to find answers to the exam questions.

Good luck with the exam!
