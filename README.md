#  Robocorp Level 2 Developer Certification 

This is my robot to complete Level 2 RPA certification from Robocorp

Robot that accepts orders from a downloaded csv file, then creates PDF receipts for each.

This works in the assistant app as well, with the exception of the vault, which the assistant does NOT like within the active directory.
