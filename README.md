23: Verify that it is possible to run your robot without manual setup
Make sure your robot works out-of-the-box just by getting it from the GitHub repository. For example, the vault should be configured so that the robot finds it without manual setup.

24: Take the certification exam
Robot built? Ready to proceed to the next step?

To pass the Robocorp Level 2 Developer Training, we will ask you to share the URL of your public GitHub robot repository in the final exam form. In case you can't get your robot working, please ask for advice on our forum or Robocorp Slack (#rpa-developer-training).

You will see if you passed the exam at the end of this exam. You can take the exam as many times as you need and use Robocorp docs to find answers to the exam questions.

Good luck with the exam!
